Device Price Analysis: 
This is my project to analyze used mobile device prices using Python and Pandas.

In this project, I have:
Cleaned the data by removing missing values and converting Yes/No columns to 1/0
Calculated the price drop percentage of devices
Found the average used price of different brands
Compared prices of 4G and 5G devices
Created some simple graphs for visualization like bar chart, scatter plot and heatmap

Files: 
device_price_analysis.py is the main Python code file
Data/used_device_data.csv is the dataset file
outputs/ folder contains all the generated plots and CSV outputs

Outputs Generated: 
Bar chart of brand average price
Histogram of price drop percentage distribution
Scatter plot of days used vs used price
Correlation heatmap of device features
Cleaned dataset saved as CSV file

Tools Used: 
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Purpose of the Project: 
I created this project to practice data analysis basics and learn how to work with real datasets using Pandas and visualizations.
